Create a test webhook endpoint
If you aren't ready to create your own webhook endpoint yet, you can deploy a test webhook app on Render.com that accepts webhook requests and dumps their contents to Render's console.

Only use this app for testing purposes.

Requirements
A Render account.
A Github account.
Step 1: Create a Github repository
Sign into your Github account and create a new repo (public or private) with a name of your choice. Within the repo, create an app.js file and paste this code into it:

// Import Express.js
const express = require('express');

// Create an Express app
const app = express();

// Middleware to parse JSON bodies
app.use(express.json());

// Set port and verify_token
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
const verifyToken = process.env.VERIFY_TOKEN;

// Route for GET requests
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  const { 'hub.mode': mode, 'hub.challenge': challenge, 'hub.verify_token': token } = req.query;

  if (mode === 'subscribe' && token === verifyToken) {
    console.log('WEBHOOK VERIFIED');
    res.status(200).send(challenge);
  } else {
    res.status(403).end();
  }
});

// Route for POST requests
app.post('/', (req, res) => {
  const timestamp = new Date().toISOString().replace('T', ' ').slice(0, 19);
  console.log(`\n\nWebhook received ${timestamp}\n`);
  console.log(JSON.stringify(req.body, null, 2));
  res.status(200).end();
});

// Start the server
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`\nListening on port ${port}\n`);
});
Step 2: Deploy a Node Express app on Render
Follow Render's instructions for deploying a Node Express app, with these differences:

Skip step 1
Use these settings for step 3:
Build command: npm install express
Start command: node app.js
In the Environment Variables section, add the variable VERIFY_TOKEN and set it to a string of your choice (e.g. vibecode).
When you're done, click the Deploy your web service button. This will take you to the app log where you will see your app being built, which can take a few minutes. You'll know it's done when you see "Your service is live" in the log.


Copy your deployed test webhook app URL, which is displayed at the top of the page under your Github repo name. (If you view the URL, you'll get a 403 error, which is expected).

Step 3: Add your test webhook app URL to your Meta app
Open a new window/tab, and navigate to the (Meta) App Dashboard > WhatsApp > Webhooks > Configuration panel.

Paste your test webhook app URL in the Callback URL field, and add the VERIFY_TOKEN environment variable string you set earlier to the Verify token field, then click Verify and save.


If verification is successful, the Meta app dashboard should refresh and you should see a list of webhook fields you can subscribe to.

Subscribe to the messages webhook field if you haven't already.

Also, in Render's app log, if you see "WEBHOOK VERIFIED", your test webhook app URL has been successfully verified.


Step 4: Send a test message
Back in the Meta app dashboard Configuration panel, scroll down to the messages webhook field, subscribe to the field if you haven't already, then click the Test link.


This will send a test message to your test webhook app. Confirm that it appears in Render app log with "Webhook received" followed by a test JSON payload:


Troubleshooting
If the test messages webhook doesn't appear in the Render app dashboard log:

Confirm that you successfully added your test webhook app URL to your Meta app (Step 3).
Confirm that your app is subscribed to the messages webhook field.
Make sure you are sending a messages test webhook; some test webhooks only work when your app is in Live mode, while others only work in Development mode (messages test webhooks work in both modes).
