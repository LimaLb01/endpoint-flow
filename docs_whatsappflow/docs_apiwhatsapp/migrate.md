Migrate an existing WhatsApp Number to a Business Account
To use an existing WhatsApp Messenger phone number with Cloud API, you must first delete your WhatsApp Messenger account.

To use an existing WhatsApp Business app phone number with Cloud API, you must either delete your account, or onboard to the platform using a solution provider who supports business app number onboarding. Remember to back up your chat history from the WhatsApp Business App. These are guides on how to do so for Android or iOS.

Note that if you delete your WhatsApp Business app phone number and then register it for use with Cloud API using the steps below, your existing messaging history will be lost, and you will be unable to use that number with the WhatsApp Business app again, unless you deregister the number from Cloud API. If you onboard via a solution provider who supports business app number onboarding, you will be able to use both the WhatsApp Business app and the solution partner's app concurrently, and your messaging history will be preserved.
