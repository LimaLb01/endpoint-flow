Flows API
The Flows API is a Graph API that enables you to perform a variety of operations with Flows.

Postman Collection
You can use the Flows API postman collection to make API requests and generate code in different languages.

Troubleshooting
See the troubleshooting section for the help with debugging API issues.

Variables Required for API Calls
The following variables are required in these API calls.

Key	Value
BASE-URL

Base URL for Facebook Graph API

Example: https://graph.facebook.com/v18.0

ACCESS-TOKEN

User access token for authentication. This can be retrieved by copying the Temporary access token from your app which expires in 24 hours.

Alternatively, you can generate a System User Access Token.

WABA-ID

This can be retrieved by copying the WhatsApp Business Account ID from your app.

FLOW-ID

ID of a Flow returned after calling Create a Flow.

API Requests

       }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
Visualizing and interacting with your Flow using the Web Preview
In order to visualize the Flows created, you can generate a web preview URL with this request. The preview URL is public and can be shared with different stakeholders to visualize the Flow. You can also interact with it in a similar way users will interact on their phones adding the URL parameters described in the table below.

The final screens will render slightly differently for the end user. We recommend you always to test on a mobile device before publishing a Flow.

Sample Request

curl '{BASE-URL}/{FLOW-ID}?fields=preview.invalidate(false)' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS-TOKEN}'
Sample Response

{
  "preview": {
    "preview_url": "https://business.facebook.com/wa/manage/flows/550.../preview/?token=b9d6....",
    "expires_at": "2023-05-21T11:18:09+0000"
  },
  "id": "flow-1"
}
The preview_url can also be embedded as an iframe into an existing website using the following code (replace url with the one returned by the API):

<iframe src="https://business.facebook.com/wa/manage/flows/550.../preview/?token=b9d6...." width="430" height="800" ></iframe>
Field	Description
preview_url

Link for the preview page. This link does not require login and can be shared with stakeholders, but the link will expire in 30 days, or if you call the API with invalidate=true which will generate a new link.

expires_at

Time when the link will expire and the developer needs to call the API again to get a new link (30 days from link creation).

The following parameters can be added to the generated URL to configure the interactive Web Preview:

URL Parameter	Description
interactive

boolean	
If true, the preview will run in interactive mode. Defaults to false.

flow_token

string	
It will be sent as part of each request. You should always verify that token on your server to block any other unexpected requests. Required for Flows with endpoint. See Sending a Flow.

flow_action

navigate | data_exchange	
First action when Flow starts. data_exchange if it will make a request to the endpoint, or navigate if it won't (this will also require flow_action_payload to be provided).

See Sending a Flow.

flow_action_payload

string	
Initial screen data in JSON format, escaped using encodeURIComponent. Required if flow_action is navigate. Should be omitted otherwise.

See Sending a Flow.

phone_number

string	
Phone number that will be used to send the Flow, from which the public key will be used to encrypt the request payload. Required for Flows with endpoint.

See Sending a Flow.

debug

string	
Show actions in a separate panel while interacting with the preview.

It will be ignored if interactive is not true.

Sample URL

https://business.facebook.com/wa/manage/flows/550.../preview/?token=b9d6...&interactive=true&flow_action=navigate&flow_action_payload=%7B%22screen%22%3A%22FIRST_SCREEN%22%2C%22data%22%3A%7B%22screen_heading%22%3A%22hello%20world%22%7D%7D&debug=true

Field	Description	Returned by default
id

string	
The unique ID of the Flow.

✓

name

string	
The user-defined name of the Flow which is not visible to users.

✓

status

string	
DRAFT: This is the initial status. The Flow is still under development. The Flow can only be sent with "mode": "draft" for testing.

PUBLISHED: The Flow has been marked as published by the developer so now it can be sent to customers. This Flow cannot be deleted or updated afterwards.

DEPRECATED: The developer has marked the Flow as deprecated (since it cannot be deleted after publishing). This prevents sending and opening the Flow, to allow the developer to retire their endpoint. Deprecated Flows cannot be deleted or undeprecated.

BLOCKED: Monitoring detected that the endpoint is unhealthy and set the status to Blocked. The Flow cannot be sent or opened in this state; the developer needs to fix the endpoint to get it back to Published state (more details in Flows Health and Monitoring).

THROTTLED: Monitoring detected that the endpoint is unhealthy and set the status to Throttled. Flows with throttled status can be opened, however only 10 messages of the Flow could be sent per hour. The developer needs to fix the endpoint to get it back to the PUBLISHED state (more details in Flows Health and Monitoring).

Each of these nodes can have one of the following health statuses assigned to the can_send_message property:

AVAILABLE: Indicates that the node meets all requirements.
LIMITED: Indicates that the node meets requirements, but has some limitations. If a given node has this value, additional info will be included.
BLOCKED: Indicates that the node does not meet one or more messaging requirements. If a given node has this value, the errors property will be included which describes the error and a possible solution.
Flow node

The Flow node will have the can_send_message property set to:

LIMITED: If published Flow is in THROTTLED state.
BLOCKED:
If unpublished Flow has one of the the publishing checks failing.
If published Flow is in BLOCKED or DEPRECATED state.
For more details about other nodes and rest of the properties see Messaging Health Status page.

Migrate Flows
Migrate Flows from one WhatsApp Business Account (WABA) to another. Migration doesn't move the source Flows, it creates copies of them with the same names in the destination WABA.

Notes:

You can specify specific Flow names to migrate, or choose to migrate all Flows in source WABA.
Flows can only be migrated between WABAs owned by the same Meta business.
If a Flow exists with the same name in the destination WABA, it will be skipped and the API will return an error message for that Flow. Other Flows in the same request will be copied.
The migrated Flow will be published if the original Flow is published, otherwise it will be in draft state.
New Flows under destination WABA will have new Flow IDs.
Request syntax
curl -X POST '{BASE-URL}/<DESTINATION_WABA_ID>/migrate_flows?source_waba_id=<SOURCE_WABA_ID>

Troubleshooting
Issue	Potential cause	Steps to resolve
Received a permission error while calling the API

Insufficient Permissions

You can check your permissions with the following link (replace WA Business Account ID and Business ID with your values)


https://business.facebook.com/settings/whatsapp-business-accounts/{waba-id}?business_id={business-id}


To use Flows API you need Message templates (view and manage) and Phone Numbers (view and manage) permissions.

Incorrect Access Token

Use the Access Token Debugger tool to verify your token permissions


https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/accesstoken


In Scopes field, you should have whatsapp_business_management, whatsapp_business_messaging. And under Granular Scopes section you should see your WABA Id under both whatsapp_business_management and whatsapp_business_messaging


After you verify access token, please try to make basic request with the the token, like GET /waba-id or GET /flow-id.

Invalid request syntax

Use the Postman Collection to make the same request.
